This is my structured plan to prepare for **FAANG and top-tier interviews**, covering **Algorithms**, **Front‚ÄëEnd System Design**, **JavaScript/FE fundamentals**, and **Behavioral interviews**. Follow along as I document the journey! üèÜ

## üß≠ Why This Plan

My first version leaned heavily on LeetCode patterns. It didn‚Äôt stick. Switching to **GreatFrontEnd** (GFE) gave me a fresh, more relevant set of problems and rekindled my daily problem‚Äësolving habit. This plan reflects that shift while keeping algorithm fundamentals and system design sharp.
